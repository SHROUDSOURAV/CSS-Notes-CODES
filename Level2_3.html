    <!-- inline => takes only required space (no margins and no padding) -->
    <!-- block => takes full space in width -->
    <!-- inline-block => similar to inline but (margins and padding is available) -->
    
    <!-- for example a block element like div uses the entire space even if the content is small -->
    <!-- problem is there is wastage of space where other stuff could have fit in ... -->

    <!-- div is a block element -->
    <!-- we can change the element display div to inline using the display property-->
    <!-- eg => display:inline -->
    <!-- we need to customize the height or width to give the content within div just enough space -->
